## What is this?
The guava-retrying module provides a general purpose method for retrying arbitrary Java code with specific stop, retry, and exception handling capabilities that are enhanced by Guava's predicate matching.

This is a fork of the [guava-retrying](https://github.com/rholder/guava-retrying) library by Ryan Holder (rholder), which is itself a fork of the [RetryerBuilder](http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/issues/detail?id=490) by Jean-Baptiste Nizet (JB). The guava-retrying project added a Gradle build for pushing it up to Maven Central, and exponential and Fibonacci backoff [WaitStrategies](http://rholder.github.io/guava-retrying/javadoc/2.0.0/com/github/rholder/retry/WaitStrategies.html) that might be useful for situations where more well-behaved service polling is preferred.

## Reason for Fork

* Add Java 11 support
* Make compatible with latest versions of Guava
* Fix all errorprone warnings in original source code

## Installation

The library is available on [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.arakelian%22%20AND%20a%3A%22elastic-indexer%22).

### Maven

Add the following to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>central</id>
        <name>Central Repository</name>
        <url>http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2</url>
        <releases>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
        </releases>
    </repository>
</repositories>

...

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.arakelian</groupId>
    <artifactId>guava-retrying</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.1</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle

Add the following to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
  testCompile 'com.arakelian:guava-retrying:3.0.1'
}
```

## Licence

Apache Version 2.0

## Quickstart

Given a function that reads an integer:
```java

public int readAnInteger() throws IOException {
   ...
}
```

The following will retry if the result of the method is zero, if an `IOException` is thrown, or if any other `RuntimeException` is thrown from the `call()` method. It will stop after attempting to retry 3 times and throw a `RetryException` that contains information about the last failed attempt. If any other `Exception` pops out of the `call()` method it's wrapped and rethrown in an `ExecutionException`.

```java
    Retryer retryer = RetryerBuilder.newBuilder()
        .retryIfResult(Predicates.equalTo(0))
        .retryIfExceptionOfType(IOException.class)
        .retryIfRuntimeException()
        .withStopStrategy(StopStrategies.stopAfterAttempt(3))
        .build();
    try {
      retryer.call(this::readAnInteger);
    } catch (RetryException | ExecutionException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
```

## Exponential Backoff

Create a `Retryer` that retries forever, waiting after every failed retry in increasing exponential backoff intervals until at most 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, retry from then on in 5 minute intervals.

```java
Retryer retryer = RetryerBuilder.newBuilder()
        .retryIfExceptionOfType(IOException.class)
        .retryIfRuntimeException()
        .withWaitStrategy(WaitStrategies.exponentialWait(100, 5, TimeUnit.MINUTES))
        .withStopStrategy(StopStrategies.neverStop())
        .build();
```
You can read more about [exponential backoff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) and the historic role it played in the development of TCP/IP in [Congestion Avoidance and Control](http://ee.lbl.gov/papers/congavoid.pdf).

## Fibonacci Backoff

Create a `Retryer` that retries forever, waiting after every failed retry in increasing Fibonacci backoff intervals until at most 2 minutes. After 2 minutes, retry from then on in 2 minute intervals.

```java
Retryer retryer = RetryerBuilder.newBuilder()
        .retryIfExceptionOfType(IOException.class)
        .retryIfRuntimeException()
        .withWaitStrategy(WaitStrategies.fibonacciWait(100, 2, TimeUnit.MINUTES))
        .withStopStrategy(StopStrategies.neverStop())
        .build();
```

Similar to the `ExponentialWaitStrategy`, the `FibonacciWaitStrategy` follows a pattern of waiting an increasing amount of time after each failed attempt.

Instead of an exponential function it's (obviously) using a [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_numbers) to calculate the wait time.

Depending on the problem at hand, the `FibonacciWaitStrategy` might perform better and lead to better throughput than the `ExponentialWaitStrategy` - at least according to [A Performance Comparison of Different Backoff Algorithms under Different Rebroadcast Probabilities for MANETs](http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/ukpew09/papers/12.pdf).

The implementation of `FibonacciWaitStrategy` is using an iterative version of the Fibonacci because a (naive) recursive version will lead to a [StackOverflowError](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/StackOverflowError.html) at a certain point (although very unlikely with useful parameters for retrying).

Inspiration for this implementation came from [Efficient retry/backoff mechanisms](https://paperairoplane.net/?p=640).
